            <h2> Become a web Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Today’s web page developer landscape is full of innovative projects and intelligent people. Together,
                these factors push the industry forward at amazing speeds, while also making it more difficult for
                individual web developers to be outstanding.
                As a new developer, one of the hardest tasks is to create a successful web developer portfolio that gets
                the attention of potential employers, especially when the job market is overcrowded, and tensions run
                high.
